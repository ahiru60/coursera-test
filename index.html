		<h1>How To Get Well</h1>
		<p><div>It’s not always easy finding the words to write in a get-well card.</div> We want to offer what comfort we can. We want to bring a smile in the middle of a tough day. We definitely DON’T want to say something insensitive.

<div>Well, relax, because there are plenty of warm, hopeful, encouraging and even funny things you can say to someone</div> who’s injured or ill. And whatever you write, the simple gesture of reaching out with a card will go a long way toward lifting that person’s spirits.

The get-well wishes you write will depend a lot on your recipient and his or her specific health situation. Whether it’s a minor injury or a serious illness, Hallmark’s writers have message ideas to guide you. We hope our tips take some of the pressure off and help you extend a little heartfelt caring to &nbsp;someone&nbsp;who&nbsp;needs&nbsp;it.</p>
